        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Briana Deniz Aguilar, who is that may you ask? A young woman who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, ended up getting accepted into UCR and followed her dreams. I first began my journey with studying Biochemistry in order to pursue a career in the medical field, soon I began to realize that Biochemistry was not the right path for me. During my second quarter of my freshman year I came to the realization and began working towards the Psychology major I took interest in by taking the required units and classes. I took the interest of majoring in psychology due to the fact that I have taken a huge interest in the way humans interact with themselves and one another. Emotions, behavior, and the way humans function became a priority for me to learn. I hope to use my psychology knowledge and degree to become a social worker or a psychologist. My goal in life is to make a difference in the world, even if it is just by being the emotional and mental support of one person by listening and guiding them with the knowledge I am acquiring from my education.<br><br>

        For the first 2 years of my college experience I have been doing remote learning and transitioning back to in-person learning has been a tough adjustment. Nonetheless, the transition has allowed me to challenge myself by seeing how I can manage my time and effort. I am currently a 2 year psychology major who is a full-time manager at my nearby Autozone and still commutes back and forth between Riverside and Los Angeles in order to see my family. In general this may not seem like a lot for most individuals since it just appears to be regular life but not many people acknowledge all the studying, sacrifices, and self-care that is required to balance a life like this.<br><br>

        At the time being I am a newly promoted manager at my current job, Autozone. Currently I have just been shadowing and training from other managers at my job. My current responsibilities/job duties that need to be fulfilled are counting the money drawers to make sure they balance out, counting the safe, and making sure all the paperwork for the end of the day is completed. Another duty of mine is to scan any returns of merchandise that were made throughout the day into our SMRFS system. One of the most important tasks that I have is making sure that the store is cleaned and ready for the next day, setting the security alarm, and locking the store. Due to the fact that I am a student, I am mainly assigned the responsibility of the closing shift at my store because I attend classes regularly in the morningâ€™s. On days that I am not working or studying I try to spend as much time as possible with my family and companion in Los Angeles. My entire family and companion are extremely supportive of my education and the way I am living my life which is all I can ask for.
